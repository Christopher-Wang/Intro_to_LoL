# Preface

League of Legends is a popular *Massively Online Battle Arena* or *MOBA* style game that has seen a continual growth in both playerbase as well as game complexity. This text serves as an introduction to some of the common terms and mechanics of the game. Within it you will find descriptions of basic terms such as _minion_ or _gold_ as well as advanced mechanics such as _lane states_. 

## Motivation 

League of Legends is a complex game that can be daunting to many new (and even experienced) players.This is because of its massive action pool: the total number of team composition matchups for ranked play (where a champion can only be selected once) exceed the estimated number of trees on Earth! This can be shown by the formula shown below:

$$\frac{\textrm{Number of champions}!}{5!(\textrm{Number of champions} - 5)!} * \frac{\textrm{(Number of champions - 5)}!}{5!(\textrm{Number of champions} - 10)!}$$

This is compounded by the complexity of role allocations, item build paths, spell interactions, etc. As one might imagine it can quickly become overwhelming. However many of the main gameplay fundamentals that are used by players can be understood and emulated by anyone. That is the purpose of this text. Inside you will not find a compedium on all optimal builds or matchup outcomes but instead a series on some of the most basic concepts that can be exploited by any player of any elo in any role. There exists many such tutorials and guides, but none combine all the basic concept (as well as esoteric game knowledge) into a singular digestible format. This book exists for players to learn the concepts that will be necessary to climb in League of Legends ranked play.
