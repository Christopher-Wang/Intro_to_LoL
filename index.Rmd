# Preface

League of Legends is a popular *Massively Online Battle Arena* or *MOBA* style game that has seen a continual growth in both playerbase as well as game complexity. This text serves as an introduction to some of the common terms and mechanics of the game. Within it you will find descriptions of basic terms such as _minion_ or _gold_ as well as advanced mechanics such as _lane states_. 

## Motivation 

League of Legends is a complex game that can be daunting to many new (and even experienced) players.This is because of its massive action pool: the total number of team composition matchups for ranked play (where a champion can only be selected once) exceed the estimated number of trees on Earth! This can be shown by the formula shown below:

$$\frac{\textrm{Number of champions}!}{5!(\textrm{Number of champions} - 5)!} * \frac{\textrm{(Number of champions - 5)}!}{5!(\textrm{Number of champions} - 10)!}$$
